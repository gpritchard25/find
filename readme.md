This is super simple and grep is way better I just did this for fun.
this will compile everywhere, and allows you to search a file for a given string.
**You can execute the file with the following command:**
(assuming it has been compiled)
./a.out [search-term] [file]
**to actually use this compile it with gcc, which should be installed by default on Unix based operating systems however you may need to configure it for windows**
